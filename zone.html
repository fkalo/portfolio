            As a new hire, I arrived at the define phase of the project and had
            been working on it with a senior designer colleague, mostly to learn
            our processes and methods.

          <p class="content">
            Since the project - actually two bigger epics handled very closely

          <p class="content">
            As our users have been diving deeper and deeper in BIM modelling,
            their documentation methods are getting more advanced day by day.
            It's not all about the floor plans anymore.
          </p>
          <p class="content highlight">
            The Zone Tool and its valuable data was originally represented on
            floor plans, but to catch up on the above mentioned demand, we
            wanted to extend the editing and display possibilities in different
            views, such as sections and elevations.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Given a long-standing product with numerous functions connecting to
            each other on different levels, we also needed to rethink some
            fundamental changes in these connections. Those might not be
            particularly perceptible, but were especially important to prepare
            the structure for future development possibilities.

            Let's look at some examples of different connecting areas and
            situations, which had to be considered and thought out well. All
            because in the architectural professions the devil's always in the
            details.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            As you may have seen in the video, there's a feature in Archicad
            called Graphic Overrides. Based on element criterias, model elements
            in the plan can be overridden with predefined visual parameters. For
            example: let's say we can paint all elements made of C10/12 concrete
            material bright yellow for some reason.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            One of our many design tasks was to define the behaviour in the
            so-called override styles, to ensure as many useful possibilities as
            we could with Zones and of course, other element types.

            I used them to think through the possibilities and their effect on
            the model, but they were also used for user tests, consultations
            with the development team and the QA Engineers used them as a
            reference in their complex test cases.

            Architects and users can collaborate on the same plan via our
            signature Teamwork functionality real-time. This can be ensured by
            element reservation - the one who reserves the element in question

            There is also a permission system behind the whole Teamwork

            at least 3 different factors affect the behaviour in and the

            way to visualise all cases and the possibilities in all kinds of

            This was my first and most complex project I've worked on so far,
            which taught me plenty. With such a huge project like this, I think
            <span class="highlight">
              it's crucial to have everyone on the same page</span
            >
            with all the details, especially the Product Owner, the Product

            We were the most effective when everyone who was involved in a
            particular story, knew the connections and background of it, so the
            common goal was clear.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            This was guaranteed by our
            <span class="highlight">interactive story map</span>, which was
            always adjusted, so every time we looked at it for clarification, it
            was up-to-date. Since I joined the project after the initial
            story-mapping - with other joining colleagues - it was very helpful
            that we went through the whole map with the team once again,
            therefore we could ask smart questions and even complement some
            parts.
