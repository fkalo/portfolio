            Contestants had to design the following materials for the Homely

              <span class="highlight">App Icon.</span> We had to stick to the

            I took two important research findings into consideration during my
            design:
          </p>
          <ul class="content list">
            <li class="list-item">
              People usually are either particularly beginners or
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              They are experienced DIY-ers, who happen to lack of some uncommon
              tools for their next project.

          <p class="content">
            Therefore I wanted to give them both the opportunity to easily find
            what they're looking for. So I included different call-to-action
            items on the <span class="highlight">Toolkit Rental</span> screen to
            ensure just that.

            The other small research - I carried out on every single person I
            talked to in 48 hours - was focusing on the visualization of the
            application.

            One consistent feedback was about the associated colour scheme. A
            good 80% of people associated some kind of yellow colour with the
            topic, which was interesting. So of course, I included the yellowish
            colour in my design.

            The available timeframe for the whole task was one weekend, we
            received the task on a Friday evening, and needed to submit our work
            on the following Monday morning.

            The most important lesson I've learnt was the fact that I really am
            able to achieve something within a couple of days.

            Also looking back on my design after a while is pretty interesting
            and educational: I realized, this job was perfect for a first round,
            but I would definitely iterate a few more times with my designs in
            the future.
